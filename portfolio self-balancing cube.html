                    The inspiration for our endeavor came from the remarkable Cubliâ€”a metal cube demonstrating exceptional balancing 
                    abilities on its edge, corner, and even the capability to leap onto its corner. Intrigued by this concept, we 
                    opted to create our version of the Cubli, opting to utilize 3D printed materials instead. Our preliminary research 
                    involved studying various videos showcasing others' attempts at building similar devices, as well as delving into 
                    the insightful demonstrations shared by Cubli's creators. Additionally, we delved into the fundamental principles 
                    of how reaction wheels function to enhance our understanding. With a comprehensive understanding of the technology 
                    and the design insights gleaned from our research, we enthusiastically embarked on the journey by initiating the 
                    process of designing and procuring the required components.

                    The initial phase of the design process revolved around creating the reaction wheels. 
                    My primary objective was to optimize their performance by striking a balance between 
                    minimizing weight at the center while increasing weight at the edges to achieve enhanced 
                    torque. To achieve this, I strategically removed material from the center of the wheels 
                    and incorporated holes along the edges, where I would later attach screws and nuts. For 
                    the outer walls of the cube, I kept the design straightforward, ensuring that visibility 
                    into the cube was unobstructed. Additionally, I designed a simple yet effective hinge 
                    mechanism to facilitate preliminary testing. With the design taking shape, the next step 
                    involved acquiring the essential components required for the project. I meticulously 
                    selected high-quality motors, a reliable MPU 1060 (combining accelerometer and gyroscope 
                    capabilities), a suitable battery, and a capable microcontroller. Having assembled all 
                    the necessary components, the stage was set for the crucial testing phase, where the true 
                    potential of the Cubli-inspired creation would be unveiled.

                    process. Implementing the hinge system, I commenced testing the code to achieve the delicate balancing 
                    act on a single corner in one axis. The progress was incredibly promising, and the device was steadily 
                    approaching the desired equilibrium point. However, just as we were on the cusp of a breakthrough, the 
                    start of the school year abruptly disrupted our momentum. Despite this temporary setback, the passion 
                    and commitment to this project remain unwavering. My determination to uncover the root cause of the 
                    oscillations that caused the device to lose balance has only grown stronger. I am eagerly anticipating 
                    the opportunity to pick up where we left off and resume refining the code and addressing any underlying issues.
