                <h1 class="sub-title">The Beginning</h1>
                <h2 class="text">  Creating the rocket involved an extensive array of calculations, ranging 
                    from determining the mass flow rate of nitrous to conducting plume simulations. These 
                    meticulous calculations were essential in ensuring the rocket's successful launch. However, 
                    despite our efforts, we encountered an unexpected hurdle further along the development process: 
                    we struggled to achieve the desired thrust we had initially envisioned. Nevertheless, undeterred, 
                    we meticulously calculated every aspect of the rocket, which served as the foundation for our 
                    subsequent design phase. My role specifically revolved around the combustion chamber team, 
                    wherein we dedicated our efforts to developing crucial components such as the injector (including 
                    the body, manifold, and coin), nozzle, fuel grain, retainer, and the chamber itself. Each team 
                    collaborated seamlessly, ensuring that every part seamlessly fit within the CAD model during the 
                    assembly phase. With the design meticulously mapped out, it was finally time to move forward and 
                    commence the manufacturing process.

                <h2 class="text"> The manufacturing phase proved to be a lengthy endeavor, further complicated by the 
                    looming time constraints posed by the end of the school term. With the urgency to complete the rocket 
                    and conduct several static fires before the competition, we found ourselves racing against the clock. 
                    Given my responsibilities within the combustion chamber team, I took charge of machining critical 
                    components such as the retainer and injector body, while also providing assistance with the nozzle 
                    and chamber. Machining the nozzle was particularly nerve-racking due to the fragile nature of graphite, 
                    which required careful handling to avoid breakage. Additionally, the stock material utilized for the 
                    chamber exhibited significant runout, posing additional challenges. Despite encountering numerous 
                    setbacks, we persevered and managed to successfully fabricate all the 
                    necessary pieces within the available timeframe and all the required parts coming out with perfect tolerances and finishes.
                    Every part coming together and forming the modelled rocket in real life.This allowed us to proceed with testing, both for the 
                    purpose of identifying potential improvements and collecting vital data required for competition 
                    submission. Nevertheless, the testing phase itself presented its own set of obstacles, demanding our 
                    commitment to resolving them effectively.

                <h1 class="sub-title">The End</h1>
                <h2 class="text">  The anticipation was palpable as we prepared for our first static fire test, with team morale soaring 
                    high and everyone eager to witness the mesmerizing plume and Mach diamonds in action. Regrettably, unforeseen issues 
                    with our ignitors and fluid system leaks thwarted our plans, forcing us to settle for a cold flow test instead. 
                    Despite this setback, the cold flow test yielded valuable data that guided our subsequent improvements. After 
                    dedicating a week to resolving the identified problems, we embarked on another test, which proved to be a resounding 
                    success. It was an exhilarating moment, etching itself as one of the most thrilling experiences of my life. However, 
                    upon reviewing the data, we realized our thrust fell significantly short of the targeted 800-pound force. Suspecting 
                    that the issue lay in the mass flow rate, we diligently recalculated the required figures over the next few days. 
                    Armed with the recalibrated calculations, we remachined the critical components, ensuring they aligned with our revised 
                    approach. Another round of testing followed, and although the data showed improvement, it still fell short of our 
                    expectations. Time became a pressing constraint, leading us to make a series of desperate attempts to refine our rocket's 
                    performance. However, before we could achieve the desired outcome, the clock ran out. With a mix of anticipation and fear, 
                    we proceeded to the competition, fervently hoping that our rocket would soar to success. And, to our immense satisfaction, 
                    it did. The moment of liftoff justified all the painstaking effort we had invested throughout the year. We will leverage 
                    the wealth of data gathered from this launch to enhance the design and performance of next year's rocket, determined to 
                    push the boundaries even further.
