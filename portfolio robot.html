                <h2 class="text">  During the initial stages of this project, 
                    a plethora of ideas were explored and brainstormed. The spectrum 
                    of possibilities stretched from envisioning a humanoid robot to conceiving 
                    a peculiar centipede-like creature. I invested considerable time in 
                    crafting concept drawings, conducting comprehensive gait analyses, and 
                    performing intricate calculations involving crucial factors like weight, 
                    torque, and speed. These calculations revolved around the gait patterns 
                    and components of the envisioned robot. Ultimately, after careful consideration, 
                    I settled on the idea of modeling the design after a bacteriophage. This decision 
                    was driven by a combination of its striking aesthetics and the original intention 
                    to create a three-legged robot. I believed that this unique choice would lend an 
                    otherworldly appearance to the robot as it moved, truly setting it apart from 
                    conventional designs.

                <h2 class="text"> The process of designing the robot presented its fair share of challenges, 
                    with a significant portion of my time dedicated to perfecting the intricate spiral shape 
                    of the body. My CAD software initially struggled with this complex form, but I persisted 
                    until I discovered a solution. Once I had overcome this hurdle, crafting the remaining 
                    parts proved relatively straightforward. However, upon reaching the assembly stage, I 
                    encountered a discouraging realization: the robot would not be able to walk. Several 
                    factors contributed to this setback. Firstly, I had only incorporated a single type of 
                    rotational movement (either yaw or roll), which proved inadequate for the symmetrical 
                    nature of the robot. Secondly, the three-legged design posed difficulties as it relied 
                    on the exertion of force from a single leg to propel itself in a specific direction, 
                    resulting in slower and inefficient movement. Lastly, my design had inadvertently grown 
                    too large, rendering it excessively heavy for the motor to effectively propel. Determined 
                    to rectify these issues, I invested countless hours into redesigning the legs, optimizing 
                    weight distribution, and scaling down the overall size of the robot. With these adjustments 
                    made, I eagerly moved forward to the final stages of the projectâ€”printing the pieces and 
                    assembling them together.

                <h2 class="text">  After investing weeks in 3D printing and utilizing SLS printing techniques with nylon 
                    and resin, I finally achieved the ideal balance of pieces that fit together seamlessly while remaining 
                    within a reasonable weight limit (under 3 pounds overall). The assembly process itself turned out to be 
                    surprisingly effortless, save for the occasional broken piece that required reprinting. Then came the 
                    moment I had been dreading: coding. However, contrary to my expectations, this step proved to be the 
                    easiest part of the entire project. Despite encountering some initial challenges with setup and 
                    intermittent SSH disconnects, I persevered and successfully programmed the bacteriophage-inspired robot, 
                    affectionately named Phage, to walk in four different directions at a steady pace of 15 cm/sec. Furthermore, 
                    Phage exhibits additional capabilities such as spinning, dancing, and waving. Looking ahead, my future plans 
                    for Phage involve incorporating voice activation using a microphone. To showcase the progress made, I have 
                    included a captivating video below that documents the various stages of the process, culminating in the robot 
                    confidently striding along.
