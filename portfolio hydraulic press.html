                <h1 class="sub-title">The Beginning</h1>
                <h2 class="text">  My journey into creating a hydraulic press began when I stumbled upon a 
                    captivating YouTube video showcasing the construction process using PVC pipes. Intrigued 
                    by the concept, I decided to embark on my own version, drawing inspiration from the video. 
                    However, one crucial difference set my approach apart—I intended to leverage 3D printing 
                    technology, believing it would streamline the process by allowing me to design and print 
                    the components instead of manually crafting them. Regrettably, I made an early misstep by 
                    neglecting to thoroughly research the properties of the material I had chosen, namely PLA. 
                    Had I taken the time to familiarize myself with its key features and limitations, I could 
                    have charted a more informed course. Nevertheless, undeterred by this oversight, I immersed 
                    myself in the CAD software, meticulously designing every piece required for the hydraulic 
                    press—from the cylinder to the piston and the stand—ensuring that they seamlessly converged 
                    into a cohesive whole. And thus, with the designs finalized, it was time to set the wheels 
                    in motion and proceed with the printing process.

                <h2 class="text"> As I delved into the realm of 3D printing, an arduous reality quickly dawned 
                    on me—it was nothing short of a nightmare. Achieving the perfect tolerances for my printed 
                    pieces to fit together flawlessly, particularly the piston and cylinder, proved to be an 
                    excruciating process, riddled with trial and error. Weeks and months elapsed as I toiled away, 
                    continually printing and reprinting, striving to attain a functional hydraulic cylinder complete 
                    with installed O-rings and other crucial components. However, when I subjected it to 
                    a water test, disappointment flooded in as the water leaked through every crevice. It became evident that PLA, 
                    the material I had utilized, possessed a porous nature, leading to frustrating leaks through the 
                    plastic itself. I felt defeated, but the relentless grip of determination compelled me to salvage 
                    the project that had consumed so much of my time and effort. It was at that moment that I resolved 
                    to reconstruct the hydraulic press using a more robust material—metal.

                    Eager to forge ahead, I dedicated the following week to mastering the skills required for operating a 
                    CNC and manual lathe. Armed with my meticulously designed CAD models, the only missing piece 
                    of the puzzle was generating the necessary CAM files. After familiarizing myself with the corresponding 
                    software, I swiftly generated the CAM files for all the parts, marking the commencement of the machining 
                    process. To my surprise, manufacturing the components using the lathe proved to be a significantly 
                    smoother endeavor compared to 3D printing. Not only was it easier, but the experience of working with the 
                    lathe was undeniably enjoyable, evoking a thrilling sense of achievement. I successfully machined nearly 
                    all the required pieces, only to encounter a minor setback when I realized that two of my  
                    designed parts had holes that were too small to accommodate the angle fittings. As the start of classes 
                    approached, I had to temporarily halt the project, but this year I am determined to finish the project, 
                    increasing the size of the system by adding multiple sets of valves for safety and accessibility.
